# My development environment in a Vagrant box

| A lathe is the only tool that can replicate itself.

Whether that is a sound statement, I can't tell. Yet, it sure makes for a nice
punchline to name your development environment in a Vagrant box.

## Getting started

```bash
$ brew install vagrant  $ install vagrant
$ sudo pip install 'ansible>=2'  # install ansible
$ make lathe  # off you go
```
